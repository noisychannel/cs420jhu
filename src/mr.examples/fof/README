Java programs to demonstrate Hadoop! 

The description of this program can be found at:
http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=randal:teach:cs420:three_s_company&s[]=fof
which also has guidance as to how to build and execute the programs.

  *** FoF.java
    Hadoop! M/R implementation 

  *** simple.input/
    Small friends list inputs

  *** fof.input/
      Big ~1000 friends lists input

Some command line examples to run these on my machine.
  
  > javac  -classpath /Users/randal/hadoop-0.20.2/hadoop-0.20.2-core.jar -d fof_classes FoF.java
  > jar cvf ./fof.jar -C fof_classes/  .
  > /Users/randal/hadoop-0.20.2/bin/hadoop jar ./fof.jar cs420.fof.FoF simple.input simple.output
