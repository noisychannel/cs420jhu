The description of this program can be found at:
http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=randal:teach:cs420:three_s_company&s[]=fof
which also has guidance as to how to build and execute the programs.

  *** fof.mapper.pl: a map program for the friends of friends program

  *** fof.reducer.pl: a reducer program for the friends of friend program

Some command line examples to run these on my machine.
  
  > cat simple.input/* | fof.mapper.pl  | sort | fof.reducer.pl 

  > /Users/randal/hadoop-0.20.2/bin/hadoop jar /Users/randal/hadoop-0.20.2/contrib/streaming/hadoop-0.20.2-streaming.jar -mapper ./fof.mapper.pl -reducer fof.reducer.pl -input ./simple.input -output ./simple.output
