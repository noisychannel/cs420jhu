CS 320/420 Parallel Programming 

Example programs used in the Concurrent Java lecture

** SimpleConc.java:

    Simplest program that creates multiple threads.

** VolatileWorks.java
  
    Program that demonstrates volatile variables.
    
** VolatileTime.java
  
    Version of VolatileWorks that only uses Volatile variables.
    This is suitable for comparing timing with SynchronizedWork
    and AtomicWorks

** NoSynchTime.java
  
  Updating a shared variable with no synchronization overhead.
  For time comparisons.

** SynchronizedWorks.java

    Using synchronized blocks on the class to update a 
    shared variable.

** SynchronizedBug.java

    Using synchronized blocks on the this object 
    creates a concurrency bug.

** AtomicIntegerWorks.java

    Program that demonstrates java atomics.
